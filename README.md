# UNDER DEVELOPMENT
* Upload to github, but this is still in development (just a PoC).
* Do not use this if you want to make a unexpected changes to your system.

# Concept
1. If we want to make a commit with gitmoji,
2. Choose a gitmoji on telescope.nvim results.
3. Then, open commit message buffer with gitmoji prefixed.
(we also can use gitmojis)

# Roadmap
* Add error handling and user-friendly messages.
* To be able to override gitmoji list by user.
* To be able to use under git submodule.
